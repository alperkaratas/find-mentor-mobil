## Current UI Issues That I See
1. Mentors have the same colour as "Mentor & Mentees" in details page
2. Mentees have no colour
3. Colours are not set in `MentorMenteesDetails.js`
4. Bottom Tab names are too long
5. Too many page to use for users

## What I did?
1. Tab name "Active Mentoships" change into "Mentorships"
2. I made one page for all mentors and mentees. (There will be a filter system to see who is Mentor who is Mentee and who is both) Named as "Us"
3. Everyone in the "Us" page list have their color on card (Mentor:#17aa90 Mentee:#2f6998 Both:#ffc400)
4. In page details now everyone have a colour in their name and canvas by their role


> Bug Fix; In details page titles for Mentees and Mentor&Mentees are correct but even if you are a just Mentor you will see on your title "Mentor & Mentee" not "Mentor". Not anymore!
